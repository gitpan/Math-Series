Math::Series version 1.00
===========================

Math::Series defines a class for simple mathematic series with a
recursive definition such as C<x_(n+1) = 1 / (x_n + 1)>. Such a recursive
definition is treated as a sequence whose elements will be added to form
a series. You can refer to the previous sequence element as well as to the
current index in the series.

Because Math::Series uses Math::Symbolic for its implementation, all results
will be Math::Symbolic objects which may contain other variables than the
sequence variable itself.

Each Math::Series object is an iterator to iterate over the elements of the
sequence starting at the first element (which was specified by the starting
element, the second argument to the new() constructor). It offers
facilities to cache all calculated elements and access any element directly,
though unless the element has been cached in a previous calculation, this
is just a shortcut for repeated use of the iterator.
